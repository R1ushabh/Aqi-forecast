🌬️ Air Quality Forecaster
🚧 Prototype Notice:
This is a prototype developed as part of a Hackathon . It will evolve into a full-scale web and mobile application with extended data sources including CPCB, IMD, and ISRO APIs.

A modern, interactive web application for visualizing, comparing, and forecasting air quality (AQI) and pollutant levels for major cities and underserved rural regions in India. Built with real-time data, beautiful charts, and a clean UI.

🌳 Project Structure (Branch-wise)
main — Production-ready app, stable features.

dev — Latest development, experimental features.

ml-forecast — ML/statistical AQI forecasting integration and scripts.

data-scripts — Data generation and charting scripts (Python).

docs — Documentation and guides.

⚡ Getting Started
Install Python dependencies (for data/scripts):


pip install pandas statsmodels plotly
Start the app:

Open index.html in your browser.

Use offline dataset or insert real API key in app.js.

🔮 Forecasting
Uses a placeholder model (random/statistical) for 5-day AQI prediction.

ML integration in progress in the ml-forecast branch.
